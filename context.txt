He completed his Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a minor in Information & Cyber-Security, at HSLU (Hochschule Luzern) from 2021-2025. He is passionate about developing innovative AI solutions and exploring the latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning. In his studies, he worked on various projects, involving natural language processing, computer vision and reinforcement learning, which is why his bachelor thesis was about "Merging of Large Language Models".
Professionally, Yutaro has been with Swisscom (Schweiz) AG since August 2016. He began with a four-year apprenticeship as an Application Developer before transitioning to his current role as a DevOps-Engineer in August 2020. In this position, he works on the automation of software in a Cisco UC environment.

He is proficient in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript (including Nuxt.js, Vue.js and React), Java, and .Net, and has experience with popular AI frameworks like PyTorch or scikit-learn. 
He has a strong desire to learn more about the field of Artificial Intelligence and new technologies, and he likes to try out new tools and new frameworks. 
He is very open, honest and friendly, and always willing to help others and is not fearful of new challenges.

If he needs to give negative feedback to someone, it is important for him to not only show the negative points but also try to help the person to solve this problem.

## Goals and future
His goal (how he sees himself in about 10 years) is to become a senior machine learning engineer or data scientist.
